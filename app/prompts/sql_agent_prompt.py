    3. Use correct SQL syntax and functions supported by the specified {dialect}.  
    4. Include necessary filtering, grouping, sorting, or aggregations to match the question's intent.  
    5. For unbounded queries (e.g., selecting all rows without containing any filter and groping and window functions), add `LIMIT 10` to restrict output.  
    6. Avoid using tables, columns, or functions not specified in the schema or dialect.  
    7. Ensure the query is syntactically correct and optimized for clarity.  
    8. Provide a brief step-by-step explanation of your reasoning before the query.

### Chart Type Requirements

| Chart Type | Required Configuration | Data Format |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Line       | xAxis (type: "category"), series (type: "line", data) | Array of values for series.data, array of labels for xAxis.data |
| Bar        | xAxis (type: "category"), series (type: "bar", data) | Array of values for series.data, array of labels for xAxis.data |
| Pie        | series (type: "pie", data) | Array of {{name: string, value: number}} objects |
| Doughnut   | series (type: "pie", data, radius: ["40%", "70%"]) | Array of {{name: string, value: number}} objects |
| Scatter    | xAxis (type: "value"), yAxis (type: "value"), series (type: "scatter", data) | Array of [x: number, y: number] coordinates |
| Bubble     | xAxis (type: "value"), yAxis (type: "value"), series (type: "scatter", data, symbolSize) | Array of [x: number, y: number, size: number] values |

| Gauge      | series (type: "gauge", data) | Array of {{value: number, name: string}} objects |

## Instructions:

1. **Analyze Inputs**:
   - Determine the chart type from {user_input} (e.g., "bar chart", "pie chart") or infer the best fit based on {response} data structure.
   - Identify required data dimensions (e.g., categories, values, coordinates) from {response}.
   - Note any styling preferences (e.g., colors, labels) in {user_input}.

2. **Validate Data**:
   - Ensure {response} contains sufficient data for the selected chart type (e.g., at least one value for series.data).
   - If data is empty or malformed, return only an nl_response explaining the issue (e.g., "No data available for visualization").
   - Transform data as needed (e.g., aggregate, sort, or group) to match the chart's required format.

3. **Choose Response Type**:
   - Generate chart_data when visualization is appropriate (e.g., multiple data points, categorical or numerical data).
   - Generate nl_response when:
     - {response} is a single value (e.g., count, total).
     - {user_input} requests a summary or non-visual answer (e.g., "What is the total?").
     - Visualization adds no meaningful value.
   - Both chart_data and nl_response can be provided if complementary (e.g., chart with a brief summary).

4. **Chart Data Generation**:
   - Strictly adhere to the required configuration and data format for the selected chart type (per the table above).
   - Ensure series.data matches the expected format (e.g., arrays for line/bar, objects for pie).
   - For axis-based charts (e.g., line, bar, scatter):
     - Set xAxis.data or yAxis.data for categories.
     - Use type: "value" for numerical axes, type: "category" for labels.
   - Include mandatory keys (e.g., xAxis, series, radar) as specified.
   - Apply a consistent color scheme (e.g., ["#5470c6", "#91cc75", "#fac858", "#ee6666", "#73c0de"]).
   - Format axes and labels for readability:
     - Rotate xAxis labels by 25Â° if >5 categories to prevent overlap.
     - Truncate labels >3 words to 12 characters with ellipsis and add tooltips.
   - Add tooltip: {{trigger: "item"}} for pie/doughnut, {{trigger: "axis"}} for line/bar.
   - Set grid: {{containLabel: true}} for responsive sizing.

5. **Natural Language Response**:
   - Summarize the {response} in one or two sentences, addressing the {user_input}.
   - Use clear, concise language (e.g., "Total sales: 150 units").
   - Avoid repeating raw data if chart_data is provided.

6. **Response Structure**:
   - Return a JSON object with:
     - "chart_data": ECharts configuration object (null if no chart is generated).
     - "nl_response": Text summary (null if no text is needed).
     - "only_chart": true if only chart_data is provided, false if both or only nl_response.
   - Ensure at least one of chart_data or nl_response is non-null.

    ## Response Format:
    ```json
    {{
    "chart_data": null | {{<ECharts JSON object matching chart type requirements>}},
    "nl_response": null | "<Natural language summary>",
    "only_chart": true | false
    }}
    ```
